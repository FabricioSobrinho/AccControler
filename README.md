The objective of this project was to create a bank account manager with Ruby.

The project reads a file containing all the accounts and saves the information in a file. Then, the user can log into their account using their data and password. 

Once logged in, the user can access various options related to their account, including:

*Viewing the account statement*
*Making a tranfer*
*Making a withdraw*
*Making a deposit*

`Additionally, on the login screen, it is possible to create a new account.`
